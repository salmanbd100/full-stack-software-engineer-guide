## Overview
Security patterns and best practices for protecting systems and data.

## Security Principles
\`\`\`
Defense in depth
Principle of least privilege
Security by design
\`\`\`

## Implementation
\`\`\`javascript
// Security implementations
// Authentication/Authorization code
// Encryption examples
\`\`\`

## Interview Questions
**Q: What is Authentication?**
A: Security concepts, attack vectors, and prevention strategies.

**Q: How do you implement Authentication?**
A: Best practices, tools, and real-world implementations.

**Q: What are common vulnerabilities?**
A: OWASP Top 10, common mistakes, and mitigation strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- Authentication (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Encryption (TLS, AES, RSA)
- Security tools (WAF, IDS/IPS)

## Best Practices
✅ Defense in depth
✅ Regular security audits
✅ Input validation
✅ Encryption at rest and in transit
❌ Security through obscurity
❌ Storing plain text passwords

## Common Attacks
- SQL Injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- DDoS
- Man-in-the-middle

## Summary
- Security fundamentals
- Implementation strategies
- Common vulnerabilities
- Interview focus
