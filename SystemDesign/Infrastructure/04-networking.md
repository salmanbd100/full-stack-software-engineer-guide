✅ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
✅ Multi-AZ deployment
✅ Automated backups
✅ Cost optimization
❌ Manual configuration
❌ Single point of failure

## Patterns
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases
- Auto-scaling
- Load balancing

## Summary
- Infrastructure fundamentals
- Cloud services
- Design patterns
- Interview focus
